## Worker Self-Onboarding (`/onboarding/:token`)

### Overview

Token-gated public form for workers to submit their own onboarding information. Replaces manual data collection. Admin generates a unique per-employee link; worker fills in and submits the form; admin reviews via the Employees tab.

### User Flows

**Admin flow:**
1. Creates employee via Employees tab → server auto-generates `onboarding_token` (UUID v4)
2. Onboarding link displayed in success banner after adding employee
3. Employees tab shows per-employee status: Pending (token exists, not submitted) / Complete (with date + "View Details" button) / — (no token)
4. Admin can view submitted data via "View Details" → modal with all fields (sensitive fields show last 4 only)

**Worker flow:**
1. Receives link `https://paytrack.lemedspa.app/onboarding/<uuid>`
2. 8-section form rendered with dark + gold PayTrack styling
3. Fills out all sections (see below)
4. Submits → success screen replaces form (non-reversible, no back button)
5. Already-submitted tokens show graceful "already received" message

### Form Sections

1. **Personal & Contact Information** — First name (required, blur-validated), last name (required, blur-validated), date of birth (required, ≥18), home phone, mobile phone (required, auto-format `(###) ###-####`, blur-validated), email (blur-validated), address subsection: street (required), city (required), state (CA preselected, 2-char US allowlist), ZIP (required, 5 or 9 digits, blur-validated)
2. **Tax (W-9)** — TIN type (SSN/EIN), TIN number (standard text input with format validation based on type), W-9 tax classification (with Business/Entity Name hint below input), W-9 signature date
3. **Drivers License / Government ID** — DL/ID number, state, expiry (must be future if provided)
4. **Professional License** *(clinical titles only: Esthetician, Aesthetic Nurse, Aesthetic Nurse Practitioner, Physician)* — Dynamic license entries with: license type, number, state, expiry (must be future), verification URL (required, with DCA guidance text), optional file upload per entry. Add/remove license entries.
5. **Insurance** *(clinical titles only)* — Company, policy number, expiry, per-occurrence coverage amount (required), aggregate coverage amount (required)
6. **Payment Information** — Bank name (required), account owner name (required). "Preferred Payment Method" radio: **Zelle** or **ACH**. Zelle contact field (required when Zelle). ACH: account type + routing + account number (required when ACH). Routing/account numbers NOT stored for Zelle.
7. **Contract Details** — Pre-filled job info grid (job title, job type, pay components, pay rate, additional pay rate from admin pre-form), time commitment bucket, other commitments, comments (full-width textarea)
8. **Acknowledgment & Attestation** — IC agreement version display, checkbox certification (required), typed signature (required), date (required)

### Sensitive Field Handling

- SSN/EIN: `type="password"` with 👁/🙈 reveal toggle. Shown as `***-**-XXXX` after blur.
- Routing/account numbers: Same `type="password"` treatment.
- Server never logs raw values. Database stores `*_encrypted` column (AES-256-GCM ciphertext) + `*_last4` masked value always stored.
- Admin modal shows only `*_last4` values (e.g., `*****6789`).

### Encryption

**Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption — detects tampering).

**Ciphertext encoding:** `base64(IV(12 bytes) || authTag(16 bytes) || ciphertext(N bytes))` stored in TEXT columns.

**Encrypted columns:** `tin_encrypted`, `bank_routing_encrypted`, `bank_account_encrypted`.

**Key location:** `PAYTRACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var — base64-encoded 32 bytes. Set in Render env vars. Never committed to git.

**Key generation:** `node scripts/generate-encryption-key.mjs` — run once, set in Render and local `.env`.

**Startup check:** Server calls `process.exit(1)` on startup if `PAYTRACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is missing or decodes to a length other than 32 bytes.

**Decrypt path:** `lib/crypto.js` `decryptValue()` — used by future 1099 export workflow. Admin "View Details" modal shows only `*_last4` and never calls `decryptValue`.

**Key rotation procedure:** Generate new key → set in Render env vars → run a one-time migration script to re-encrypt all existing rows with the new key → remove old key. (No rows exist as of first deploy; this procedure applies to future rotations.)

**Library:** Node built-in `crypto` module (`createCipheriv`/`createDecipheriv`). No added dependencies.

### Validation (client + server)

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| SSN | `/^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/` |
| EIN | `/^\d{2}-\d{7}$/` |
| ZIP | 5 digits or 9 digits (with or without dash) |
| Phone | ≥10 digits when stripped of formatting, ≤15. Mobile phone required. |
| State | 2-char uppercase allowlist (50 states + DC) |
| Bank routing | 9 digits + ABA checksum: `(3*(d1+d4+d7) + 7*(d2+d5+d8) + (d3+d6+d9)) % 10 === 0` |
| Bank account | 4–17 digits |
| Date of birth | Past date, worker must be ≥18 years old |
| License/insurance expiration | Must be strictly future if provided |
| Attestation | Checkbox required, typed signature required, date required |
| Time commitment bucket | One of under_15, 15_to_25, 25_to_35, over_35 (required) |
| Payment method | zelle or ach only (required); other values rejected |
| Routing + account | Required when payment_method=ach; ignored (not stored) when zelle |
| Zelle contact | Required when payment_method=zelle |

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| GET | `/onboarding/:token` | None (token validates) | Render onboarding form |
| POST | `/api/onboarding/:token` | None (token validates) | Submit onboarding data |
| GET | `/api/admin/employees/:id/onboarding` | Admin password header | Fetch submitted data (masked) |
| POST | `/api/admin/employees/:id/onboarding-token` | Admin password header | Regenerate token |
| POST | `/api/admin/employees/:id/send-link` | Admin password header | Send onboarding link via SMS or email |

### Database Changes

**`employees` table — 8 new columns:**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `phone` | TEXT | Primary phone |
| `designation` | TEXT | Job title/role |
| `contractor_type` | TEXT | Classification (W-2/1099) |
| `start_date` | DATE | Employment start |
| `ic_agreement_signed` | BOOLEAN | IC agreement accepted |
| `ic_agreement_signed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When signed |
| `onboarding_token` | TEXT UNIQUE | UUID for form link |
| `onboarding_completed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When form was submitted |

**New `employee_onboarding` table (~35 columns):** Full form submission, one row per employee. Identity, address, tax, license, insurance, banking fields. `tin_encrypted`, `bank_routing_encrypted`, `bank_account_encrypted` stored as AES-256-GCM ciphertext. `*_last4` columns always populated. `submitted_at`, `ip_address`, `ic_agreement_version` for audit trail.

**Migration 003 applied 2026-04-16:**
- `time_commitment_hours_per_week` (INTEGER) removed; replaced by `time_commitment_bucket` TEXT CHECK IN (under_15, 15_to_25, 25_to_35, over_35)
- `payment_method` constrained to CHECK IN (zelle, ach); values direct_deposit and check no longer accepted

### Validation Library (`lib/onboarding-validation.js`)

Shared module used by both server.js and tests. Exports: `validateSSN`, `validateEIN`, `validateZip`, `validatePhone`, `validateState`, `validateBankRouting`, `validateBankAccount`, `validateDOB`, `validateFutureDate`, `extractLast4SSN`, `extractLast4Routing`, `extractLast4Account`, `validateOnboarding`, `JOB_TITLES`, `CLINICAL_TITLES`.

### Tests

- `test/validation.test.js` — 113 tests covering all validators + full form validation + conditional ACH/Zelle rules + time_commitment_bucket enum + mobile phone required + insurance coverage amounts required for clinical titles + conditional license/insurance validation. Written red-first.
- `test/crypto.test.js` — 23 tests covering AES-256-GCM round-trip, non-determinism (random IV), tampering rejection, wrong-key rejection, empty string, null/undefined passthrough, `isEncrypted` heuristic, `generateKey`, and invalid key detection. Written red-first.

### Design Decisions

- Token security: UUID v4 via `crypto.randomUUID()` (Node built-in, no dependency)
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM via Node built-in `crypto` module. No new dependencies. Key in env var. Startup fails loudly if key is missing or wrong length.
- pgsodium not used: application-layer AES-256-GCM chosen over pgsodium for simpler setup and no Supabase extension dependency. Same security guarantees for this use case.
- Send Link feature: SMS via Twilio (+12134442242) and email via Resend (ops@lemedspa.com, CC lea@lemedspa.com)
- No 1099 export (out of scope)
- Never store plaintext SSN/EIN in plain database columns — only in `*_encrypted` columns

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose | Key fields |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `employees` | Staff profiles | name, pin, email, hourly_wage, commission_rate, pay_type, onboarding_token, onboarding_completed_at |
| `employee_onboarding` | Worker onboarding submissions | employee_id, personal info, address, tax (W-9), license, banking, attestation |
| `time_entries` | Daily hours | employee_id, date, start_time, end_time, break_minutes, hours |
| `client_entries` | Service work | time_entry_id, client_name, procedure_name, amount_earned, tip_amount, tip_received_cash |
| `product_sales` | Sales commissions | time_entry_id, product_name, sale_amount, commission_amount |
| `invoices` | Submitted summaries | employee_id, pay_period_start/end, totals, submitted_at, email_sent |

---

## Earning Calculation Logic

```
Total Hours    = sum(time_entries.hours) for period
Total Wages    = Total Hours × employee.hourly_wage
Total Comms    = sum(client_entries.amount_earned) for period
Total Tips     = sum(client_entries.tip_amount) for period
Product Comms  = sum(product_sales.commission_amount) for period
Cash Tips Recv = sum(client_entries.tip_received_cash) for period
Total Payable  = Wages + Comms + Tips + Product Comms - Cash Tips Recv
```

Components included depend on employee's `pay_type` setting.

## Technical Notes

- **Timezone:** All date logic uses Los Angeles time (America/Los_Angeles)
- **Keep-alive:** Pings every 14 minutes to prevent Render free tier spin-down
- **PWA:** Service worker registered for offline capability
- **Migration history:** SQLite → Supabase PostgreSQL (completed)
- **Design:** Dark + gold luxury theme matching lemedspa-website
