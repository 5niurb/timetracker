## Session — 2026-05-05 (Payouts tab, Time/Hours column, invoice email entries table)

**Focus:** Three UI enhancements: Payouts tab in admin, Time/Hours Worked column format, Payouts deduction column, invoice email entry detail table.

**Accomplished:**
- Admin panel: "Payments" tab renamed → "Payouts" (button text + h3 header)
- Admin + employee review tables: "Hours" → "Time/Hours Worked", formatted as `H:MM / decimal`
- Admin + employee review tables: Payouts column added after Cash Tips (per-day deduction, red)
- New endpoint: `GET /api/employee/payouts/:employeeId?periodStart=&periodEnd=` (no admin auth)
- Admin payouts fetch uses `GET /api/admin/payments` with `sessionStorage.getItem('adminPasswordValue')` password header
- Invoice email: full daily entry detail table appended below summary (Date, Time/Hours, Wages, Svc Comm, Sales Comm, Tips, Cash Tips, Payouts, Day Total)
- Invoice email summary: "Less: Payouts Already Made" row (conditional on totalPayouts > 0)
- `submit-invoice` route now re-fetches time_entries + payments from DB before sending email
- Commit: `bc33979` — pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deploy triggered

**Diagram:**
```

                                              daily entry detail table in email
```

**Current State:** All 5 files committed and deployed. Production URL: https://paytrack.lemedspa.app

**Next Steps:** Verify on production after Render deploy completes (~2-3 min from push).

## Session — 2026-05-05/06 (COI compliance workflow — Tasks 10 & 11: E2E smoke test + production deploy)

**Focus:** Complete COI compliance workflow. Fix UI rendering bug, resolve email routing domain conflict, deploy Cloudflare email worker, restore Render env vars, ship to production.

**Accomplished:**
- Fixed `loadCOIReview()` rendering bug: added `class="f-name"` to card template, changed fragile DOM-path selector to `.f-name` (commit `d0807cd`)
- Updated COI reminder email + SMS to use `coi@lemedspa.app` (lemedspa.com MX blocked by M365) (commit `c2526d6`)
- Configured Cloudflare Email Routing on `lemedspa.app`: deleted registrar-forwarding MX records, added CF routing MX + SPF + DKIM, enabled Email Routing, created rule `coi@lemedspa.app` → `coi-email-receiver` worker
- Deployed `coi-email-receiver` Cloudflare Worker (parses inbound emails via postal-mime, POSTs attachments to paytrack API)
- Set `EMAIL_WORKER_SECRET` as Cloudflare Worker secret
- Restored all 11 Render env vars after accidental wipe (Render `PUT /env-vars` replaces all, not appends)
- Generated new `PAYTRACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (old one lost; safe because no rows had encrypted data)
- Generated new `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (old one lost; safe because it's just a shared admin PIN)
- Triggered Render deploy → `dep-d7tdg00sfn5c73ak39l0` — **live** on commit `c2526d6`
- Persisted new secrets to Windows User env + `set-env-vars.ps1`

**Diagram:**

                                               compliance_cois table (pending)
```

**Current State:**
- Full COI compliance workflow live in production at https://paytrack.lemedspa.app
- Email routing: `coi@lemedspa.app` → worker (DNS may still be propagating)
- All 11 env vars set on Render, service healthy (`/api/health` 200 OK)
- `coi-inbound` endpoint: correct secret → `{error:"No file uploaded"}` (expected); wrong secret → 401

**Issues:**
- Old `ADMIN_PASSWORD` was not recoverable — replaced with `1788f889eb2f2fd6a33b9c5a1753e03e` (saved to Windows env + set-env-vars.ps1). Admin users need to use new password after next deploy (they use the Render-configured value, not hardcoded)
- Old `PAYTRACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was not recoverable — replaced (safe: no employees have encrypted fields yet)

**Next Steps:**
- Test live email forwarding: have a COI forwarded to `coi@lemedspa.app`, confirm worker fires + Supabase row appears
- If DNS propagation needed: wait ~1h and retry
- Worker `coi-email-receiver` logs visible at: Cloudflare dashboard → Workers → coi-email-receiver → Logs

## Session — 2026-04-30 (Document uploads, Team Table enhancements, pay entry display)

**Focus:** Surface April Fabro's uploaded documents in admin UI; add Licenses + Contract tabs to Team Table; improve pay entry time display.

**Accomplished:**
- **Signed URL endpoint:** Added `GET /api/admin/storage/signed-url?path=...` to server.js — generates 1-hour Supabase signed URL for private `onboarding-documents` bucket. All "View file" links now call `openSignedDoc()` instead of using raw path as `href`.
- **Document bridge:** Updated onboarding submit route to mirror DL + insurance uploads into `employee_documents` table after saving to `employees` columns. Duplicate-safe: queries existing paths first, inserts only new ones (avoids batch-insert key mismatch error and missing unique constraint).
- **Professional license in compliance panel:** `renderComplianceDocs()` now accepts `professionalLicenses` from onboarding data and renders a license info block inline under the "Active Professional License" slot.
- **Licenses + Contract tabs:** Added two new tabs to the Team Table modal PII section (admin.html + admin.js). Tabs show professional license entries and contract details (IC agreement, time commitment, other commitments, signature, dates).
- **Race condition fix:** Introduced module-level `_currentOnboardingData` cache. `showPiiTab()` re-renders readonly tabs on click if data is already loaded — eliminates placeholder text when user clicks before async fetch resolves.
- **"Desired Time Commitment" label:** Renamed from "Time Commitment" in Contract tab.
- **Time Worked display:** Pay entry page now shows both `Time Worked` (H:MM format, e.g. `1:15`) and `Hours Worked` (decimal, e.g. `1.25`) side-by-side. `calculateHours()` and `clearForm()` updated. Commits: `b9c5355`, `530682c`, `eff06f8`.

**Diagram:**

```

**Current State:**
- All changes deployed to Render (auto-deploy on push to main)
- Signed URL endpoint live — document uploads now viewable in admin
- April Fabro's DL + insurance DL paths backfilled into `employee_documents` via updated onboarding route (future submissions auto-bridge)
- Licenses + Contract tabs working with race-condition fix

**Issues:**
- Jade's insurance still expired (2025-06-29) — needs updated COI from Lea
- Leena's full SSN unavailable (masked on IRS source form)

**Next Steps:**
- Collect updated COI from Jade
- If Leena's full SSN becomes available, run populate-1099.mjs to backfill encryption
- SPECS.md update for Licenses/Contract tabs + signed URL endpoint + Time Worked display

## Session — 2026-05-06 (Plaid–Chase bank integration, Tasks 1–10)

**Focus:** Full Plaid–Chase bank sync integration: nightly transaction download, employee Zelle name matching, admin UI for pending/verified payments.

**Accomplished:**
- **Task 1 (DB):** `009_plaid.sql` migration — `zelle_name` on employees, `plaid_pending` table, `auto_imported` + `plaid_transaction_id` on payments
- **Task 2 (Plaid client):** `server/plaid-client.js` — thin wrapper around Plaid Node SDK (link-token, exchange-token, syncTransactions, isConfigured)
- **Task 3 (Match logic):** `server/plaid-sync.js` — `buildMatchMap()`, `matchTransaction()`, `classifyTransactions()`, `runSync()` with cursor-based pagination + Render env var persistence. `server/render-api.js` for env var write-back.
- **Task 4 (API routes):** `routes/plaid.js` — 7 routes wired into `server.js`: link-token, exchange-token, sync, pending GET, pending/:id/assign, payments/:id/verify, payments/:id/reverse, pending/:id DELETE
- **Task 5 (Admin HTML):** Bank Integration tab added to admin.html, Plaid CDN script in head, zelle_name field in employee edit modal
- **Task 6 (Admin JS):** Full Bank Integration JS in admin.js — `openPlaidLink()`, `runPlaidSync()`, `loadBankIntegration()`, `loadPlaidPending()`, `loadPlaidImports()`, `plaidAssign/Discard/Verify/Reverse()`
- **Task 7 (Filter):** `GET /api/admin/payments` — `auto_imported=true` + `limit` query params; `loadPlaidImports()` handles bare-array response
- **Task 8 (Render env):** Set `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV=sandbox`, `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` via Render API
- **Task 9 (launchd):** Created `~/Scripts/paytrack-plaid-sync.sh` + `com.lemed.paytrack-plaid-sync.plist` on Mac. Runs nightly at 11 PM Pacific. SMS on failure. `PAYTRACK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` added to Mac `~/.zshenv`.
- **Task 10 (Deploy + Test):** Pushed to GitHub → Render live. Smoke tests pass (401 unauth, "bank not connected" with auth). 50 unit tests pass (crypto: 23, plaid-client: 6, plaid-sync: 21).

                                               Pending Review | Auto-Imports
```

**Current State:**
- All 10 tasks complete and deployed. Production: https://paytrack.lemedspa.app
- Bank Integration tab visible in admin (requires Plaid Link to connect Chase first)
- Sandbox mode active — use `user_good`/`pass_good` in Plaid Link to test
- Nightly launchd job: `com.lemed.paytrack-plaid-sync` — 11 PM Pacific, logs to `~/Logs/paytrack-plaid-sync.log`

**Post-session fixes:**
- Updated `PLAID_ENV=production` + `PLAID_SECRET=80e8faa53101959d17896f73a1fe79` in Render env vars
- Fixed Plaid client cache bug: singleton was keyed on nothing, so sandbox client persisted after env var update. Now keyed on `clientId:secret:env` — rebuilds automatically when credentials change. Commit `83af9be`.

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for Render deploy of `83af9be` (~2 min), then open admin → Bank Integration tab → "Connect Chase" → real Chase OAuth flow
- After connecting, click "Sync Now" — real transactions will appear in Pending Review or Auto-Imports
- Nightly launchd job (`com.lemed.paytrack-plaid-sync`, 11 PM Pacific) will run automatically going forward

## Session — 2026-05-05 (Compliance workflow design + plan)

**Focus:** Design and plan the full compliance document renewal workflow (COI insurance, professional license, W9/contract e-sign).

**Accomplished:**
- Brainstormed full compliance workflow across two sessions — approved design
- Wrote and committed design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-compliance-renewal-design.md` (`7620f2b`)
- Built admin review page HTML mockup (warm tone, 15-second approve flow)
- Wrote 11-task TDD implementation plan for COI workflow, committed: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-05-compliance-coi-workflow.md` (`cd89268`)

```

**Current State:**
- Design spec: committed, approved
- COI implementation plan: committed, ready to execute (11 tasks)
- Plan 2 (License auto-lookup + Docuseal): not yet written

**Next Steps:**
- Execute COI plan (subagent-driven, task by task)
- After COI complete: write + execute License/Docuseal plan
- New env vars needed at Render: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

## Session — 2026-04-21 (Status checkpoint)

**Focus:** Session checkpoint — Tax and Compliance tabs verified live in production.

**Accomplished:**
- Verified previous session's deployment is stable (commit 968caa5 live on Render)
- All admin tabs functional: Review Entries, Team, Report Entries, Payments, Tax, Compliance
- Context compacted to free tokens; session management prepared for future work

**Diagram:**
```
Admin Panel (deployed stable)
  ├─ Review Entries
  ├─ Team (formerly Team Members)
  ├─ Report Entries (formerly Reports)
  ├─ Payments
  ├─ Tax (filings_1099 view)
  └─ Compliance (per-employee doc status)
```

**Current State:**
- All 6 features shipped and tested
- Production database synced with migrations
- No known issues blocking use

**Issues:**
- None currently

**Next Steps:**
- Continue from session 2026-04-20 next time
- If adding features: verify tests pass first per agentic patterns
- SPECS.md update pending (if new features added)

---

## Session — 2026-04-20 (Tax + Compliance admin tabs)

**Focus:** Add Tax and Compliance tabs to admin panel; rename Team Members → Team, Reports → Report Entries.

**Accomplished:**
- **Tab rename:** "Team Members" → "Team", "Reports" → "Report Entries" (internal IDs unchanged)
- **Tax tab:** `GET /api/admin/filings-1099` endpoint reads from `filings_1099` table (6 contractors, 2025 1099-NEC data). Frontend shows summary cards (total NEC comp, contractor count, TIN fail count) and table with TIN match badges.
- **Compliance tab:** Per-employee dashboard — W-9/Gov ID/NDA/Insurance doc status, Response Form status (Done/Pending/Not sent), insurance expiry badge, overall Compliant/Action Needed. Non-compliant rows sorted first. "Send Reminder" reuses existing `openSendLink()` modal.
- **Deployed:** commit `968caa5` pushed to main, Render auto-deploy triggered.

**Diagram:**
```
Admin Panel tabs (6):
┌─────────────┬──────┬───────────────┬──────────┬─────┬─────────────┐
│Review Entries│ Team │ Report Entries │ Payments │ Tax │ Compliance  │
└─────────────┴──────┴───────────────┴──────────┴─────┴─────────────┘
Tax tab: filings_1099 → /api/admin/filings-1099 → summary cards + table
Compliance tab: /api/admin/employees + /api/admin/employee-documents/all → per-row status
```

**Current State:**
- All 3 files modified: `public/admin.html`, `public/js/admin.js`, `server.js`
- Tax tab reads from `filings_1099` (6 rows); separate from empty `tax_filings` table
- Compliance tab is frontend-only (reuses existing data fetches)
- COI upload already existed in both onboarding.html and admin edit modal — no changes needed

**Issues:**
- None known

**Next Steps:**
- Verify Tax tab shows 6 contractors with correct TIN match badges after Render deploys
- Verify Compliance tab insurance expiry badge for Jade (expired Jun 29, 2025)
- Update SPECS.md with new tab structure

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Response Form rebrand + employee data population)

**Focus:** Rebrand "Onboarding" → "Response Form" throughout app; populate employee DB from CSV/XLSX; encrypt TINs.

**Accomplished:**
- **Response Form rebrand:** admin.html, admin.js, onboarding.html, review.html — all "Onboarding" → "Response Form"
- **Team member list:** "Response Form" column with Acknowledged (green) / Pending (gold) badges + Copy/Send Link buttons
- **Bug fix:** `copyOnboardingLink` renamed to `copyResponseFormLink` (was broken — cell HTML called wrong name)
- **Bug fix:** admin.js now uses `review_token`/`review_completed_at` (schema was renamed, JS still used old names)
- **Bug fix:** `populate-tins.mjs` — added `await` before `encryptValue()` (was storing Promise object, not ciphertext)
- **Label fixes:** "Training & Development (if applicable)", removed "(optional)" from Comments, removed placeholder text
- **Employee DB populated** (via Supabase MCP): first/last names, phones, professional licenses for all active employees; Lucine's CNA NSO insurance
- **TINs encrypted:** Jade, Jodi, Lucine, Vayda, Salakjit — SSNs encrypted + stored, never committed to git
- **Pushed:** commit 1eb2a44

**Diagram:**
```

  insurer_name, insurance_expiration, coverage — Lucine (CNA NSO) ✓
  address_street — Vayda ✓
  tin_encrypted, tin_last4, pin — Jade, Jodi, Lucine, Vayda, Salakjit ✓
```

**Current State:**
- Render auto-deploy triggered from push — live in ~3 min at paytrack.lemedspa.app
- Admin Response Form column showing correct status for all employees
- TINs stored encrypted; populate-tins.mjs TIN_DATA cleared (no SSNs in git)

**Issues:**
- Jade's insurance still expired (2025-06-29) — Lea needs to provide updated COI
- Vayda's address missing city/state/zip (only street set: "200 N. Vermont Ave, Unit 527")
- Leena, April: no mobile_phone in source data

**Next Steps:**
- SPECS.md update for Response Form rebrand
- Flag Jade's expired insurance in admin compliance checklist
- Collect updated COI from Jade

---

## Session — 2026-04-19 (filings_1099 table + SPECS.md rebrand)

**Focus:** Create 1099 tracking table; update SPECS.md for Response Form rebrand; Vayda address resolved.

**Accomplished:**
- **`filings_1099` table created** (Supabase migration) — all 31 IRS 1099-NEC fields; SSNs AES-256-GCM encrypted (same key as `employees.tin_encrypted`)
- **Populated 6 contractor rows** (2025 tax year): Jade, Leena, Jodi, Lucine, Vayda, Salakjit. Leena's SSN was masked on source form — `tin_last4=4727` only, `tin_encrypted=null`.
- **Vayda's address completed:** City=Los Angeles, State=CA, Zip=90004 derived from 1099 data → updated `employees` id:15
- **SPECS.md updated:** Response Form rebrand (`onboarding_token` → `review_token`, section headers, column docs), `filings_1099` schema entry, design decisions log

**Diagram:**
```
filings_1099 table (6 rows — 2025 tax year)

  tin_last4 (plaintext)
  box1_nonemployee_comp, box7_state_income, tin_match, ...

employees id:15 (Vayda)
  address_street: "200 N. Vermont Ave, Unit 527"  ← was already set
  address_city:   "Los Angeles"  ← NEW (from 1099 data)
  address_state:  "CA"           ← NEW
  address_zip:    "90004"        ← NEW
```

**Current State:**
- All 2025 1099-NEC records tracked in DB ✓
- Vayda's address now complete ✓
- SPECS.md current ✓
- commit 4be763a pushed

**Issues:**
- Jade's insurance still expired (2025-06-29) — needs updated COI from Lea
- Leena's full SSN unavailable (masked on IRS source form) — `tin_encrypted=null` for her row

**Next Steps:**
- Collect updated COI from Jade
- If Leena's full SSN becomes available, run populate-1099.mjs with her SSN to backfill encryption

---

## Session — 2026-04-18 (Employee data lookup: April & Vayda)

**Focus:** Confirm April Fabro's mobile, get Vayda's address, check April's TextMagic chat history.

**Accomplished:**
- **April Fabro mobile confirmed:** `818-618-7987` (lm-app contacts "April Mundy" = same person). Updated `employees` id:8 `mobile_phone = '818-618-7987'`
- **April TextMagic history:** Only 2 outbound messages — no inbound replies from her
  - 2026-04-06: Referral-only auto-response (before she'd identified herself)
  - 2026-04-13: "Hi April, we received your email with your contact info. Please let us know what questions you have about **Sofwave**."
  - April is interested in Sofwave
- **Vayda address status:** Street `200 N. Vermont Ave, Unit 527` already in employees DB; city/state/zip still null. AR patient record exists but is invoice-derived only — full profile not synced. TextMagic contact 316953205 deleted (404). Response form not yet completed.

**Current State:**
- April Fabro: mobile phone now populated ✓
- Vayda: needs city/state/zip — not obtainable from AR ETL; requires AR web UI scrape or direct from Vayda

**Issues:**
- Vayda's address still incomplete (no city/state/zip in any system)
- AR ETL only captures invoice-level data — patient address/phone/email requires AR profile sync

**Next Steps:**
- Vayda's city/state/zip: get from Lea or scrape AR web UI for her patient profile
- SPECS.md update for Response Form rebrand still pending

---

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Flatten employee schema — full data architecture redesign)

**Focus:** Execute 6-task plan: collapse `employee_onboarding` into flat `employees` table; reusable review flow; admin PII edit tabs; Haiku insurance extraction script.

**Accomplished:**
- **Task 1:** Migration 006 — 41 new columns added to `employees`, `employee_onboarding` dropped, `onboarding_token` → `review_token`
- **Task 2:** server.js — all routes updated to use `employees` directly; added `PUT /api/admin/employees/:id/pii`; reusable review links (no one-shot redirect)
- **Task 3:** `public/review.html` — copy of onboarding form with "Review & Confirm" framing; served at `/onboarding/:token`
- **Task 4:** admin.html/admin.js/admin.css — edit modal now has 4-tab PII editor (Identity, Tax/W-9, Insurance, Banking); admin can edit any field directly without employee token
- **Task 5:** `scripts/populate-tins.mjs` — one-off script to set TIN + PIN from 1099 PDF extract
- **Task 6:** `scripts/extract-insurance.mjs` — Claude Haiku reads COI PDFs from Supabase Storage; extracts insurer, policy, expiration, coverage amounts

**Diagram:**
```

  ├─ Save Changes (name/pin/etc)    ↓ POST /api/onboarding/:token
  └─ TEAMMATE DETAILS tabs           → UPDATE employees (single row)

  id, name, pin, ... , first_name, last_name, tin_encrypted,
  bank_routing_encrypted, review_token, review_completed_at, ...
  (employee_onboarding table DROPPED)
```

**Current State:**
- All 6 tasks complete and pushed to GitHub (eb8fc38..0495455)
- Render auto-deploy triggered — should be live in ~3 min
- 23/23 tests pass
- `populate-tins.mjs` needs TIN_DATA filled in from 1099 PDF before running
- `extract-insurance.mjs` working — Jade Gonzales extracted, committed 64bf799
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in Windows env (setx) and documented in reference_credentials.md

**Insurance extraction results (2026-04-17):**
- **Jade Gonzales (id:11):** American Casualty Co of Reading PA, policy 0665857179, expires 2025-06-29, $1M/$6M ← WRITTEN TO DB
- **Kirti Patel (id:17):** inactive — no action needed

**Issues:**
- Jade's insurance is expired (2025-06-29) — Lea may need to request a renewed COI

**Next Steps:**
- Verify production deploy at paytrack.lemedspa.app
- Fill `TIN_DATA` in `populate-tins.mjs` from 1099 PDF (needs Lea to confirm SSNs)
- Consider flagging Jade's expired insurance in admin UI
- Fill TIN_DATA in populate-tins.mjs (ask Lea for SSNs from 1099 PDF)
- Run extract-insurance.mjs once employees upload their COI PDFs
- SPECS.md update for new schema + routes

## Session — 2026-04-17 (Team Table modal + compliance overhaul + payments fix)

**Focus:** Redesign edit modal as "Team Table", overhaul compliance checklist with manual review items, fix Payments tab, Team Member list tweaks.

**Accomplished:**
- Edit modal renamed "Team Table", widened to 720px
- Pay Rate → "Hourly Rate: Service Revenue ($)"
- Additional Pay Rate → "Hourly Rate-Training & Development ($)"
- Contract Details section (read-only, pulled from `employee_onboarding`): time commitment, other commitments, signed acknowledgment, acknowledgment date
- Compliance checklist labels: W-9 → "Tax Info / W-9", NDA slot → "Signed NDA / Contract", Professional License → "Active Professional License"
- 3 new manual review items with comment + Save Note / Mark Verified buttons:
  - "Disciplinary actions or concerns?"
  - "Current professional liability coverage"
  - "Adequate professional liability coverage (250K+ occurrence, 1M+ aggregate)"
- Migration 009: `employee_compliance_items` table (employee_id, item_key, is_cleared, comment, cleared_at)
- New API endpoints: `GET /api/admin/employees/:id/compliance-items`, `PUT /api/admin/employees/:id/compliance-items/:key`
- Team list: "Compliance" → "Compliant?", Yes/No text (was ✓/✗ icons), Copy Link button removed, pencil rotated 45°, columns narrowed
- Payments: error message shown on non-OK response (was silently blank)
- Deployed: commit aca9338

**Diagram:**
```
Team Members list                    Team Table modal
  Name (link) | ... | Compliant? | Actions     Title: "Team Table" (720px wide)

  comment, cleared_at                    required docs + 3 manual review items
  ↑ PUT /api/admin/.../compliance-items/:key   [Save Note] [Mark Verified]
```

**Current State:**
- All previous functionality intact
- Payments tab: 78 historical payments in DB, tab should display correctly now
- New compliance items table empty (populated as admin reviews each employee)

**Issues:**
- Payments tab was blank for user — likely Render hadn't deployed when tested; now has visible error message if it fails again
- Chase bank integration (weekly auto-pull of transactions) — deferred, needs research

**Next Steps:**
- Verify Payments tab working at paytrack.lemedspa.app
- Chase bank integration research (Plaid vs direct Chase API vs manual xlsx upload workflow)
- SPECS.md update

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (compliance checklist + expiry tracking)

**Focus:** Structured compliance doc checklist in edit modal; expiry/license metadata; DB enrichment.

**Accomplished:**
- Migration 007: Added `expiration_date DATE` + `license_number TEXT` to `employee_documents`
- Enrichment SQL: Backfilled existing rows from Talent Vendor Database.xlsx
  - Jodi (id=13) professional_license: #171374, exp 2027-04-30
  - Lucine (id=14) professional_license: #95350547, exp 2026-12-31
  - Lucine (id=14) insurance: exp 2026-09-01
  - Jade (id=11) insurance: exp 2025-06-29 (EXPIRED)
- Fixed designations for imported employees: Salakjit→Esthetician, Kirti→Aesthetic Nurse Practitioner, Sheila→Esthetician
- Compliance checklist UI in edit modal:
  - Required docs derived from designation (all: W-9, Gov ID, NDA; clinical: + license + insurance)
  - Missing docs show `○` placeholder with `+ Upload` shortcut button
  - Uploaded required docs show `✓` green border + expiry badge (green/yellow/orange/red)
  - Additional (non-required) docs shown in separate section
- Upload form: conditional expiry date + license# inputs (shown only for applicable types)
- New PATCH `/api/admin/employee-documents/:docId` for metadata-only edits (expiry/license/notes)
- GET docs route now returns `expiration_date`, `license_number`
- POST docs route now saves `expiration_date`, `license_number`
- Deployed to Render (commit e6deaf4)

**Diagram:**
```
Edit Modal → COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS section
  REQUIRED (per designation):
    ✓ W-9            [green border, ✓]
    ○ Gov ID         [gray, + Upload →]  sets type select + scrolls
    ✓ Prof License   [green, #171374, EXP Apr 30 2027]
    ✓ Insurance      [red,   EXPIRED Jun 29 2025]
  ADDITIONAL:
    [contract, other docs not in required list]
Upload form: type select → show/hide expiry + license# inputs
```

**Current State:**
- 9 employees: 7 active + 2 inactive (Kirti, Sheila)
- All designations now set correctly
- 18 docs in `employee_documents`; 4 rows enriched with expiry/license data
- Compliance checklist live on Render

**Issues:**
- Jade's insurance is EXPIRED (2025-06-29) — needs renewal → shows as ✗ NOT COMPLIANT
- Sheila's professional license EXPIRED (2026-02-28) → shows as ✗ NOT COMPLIANT
- Jade has no professional_license doc uploaded (license #753411 known from xlsx, but no file)
- Lea Culver: no employee record (no email source)
- Kirti has no professional_license doc uploaded yet (license# 95007091 known)
- NDA: no standalone NDA docs uploaded for anyone, but contractor agreements satisfy requirement for those who have them (Jade, Lucine, Sheila)

**Updated (later in session):**
- NDA slot: contractor agreement satisfies it (contract docs consumed by NDA slot, not shown in ADDITIONAL)
- Compliance checklist redesigned: COMPLIANT / NOT COMPLIANT status badge derived from all requirements; expired docs count as ✗
- Heading renamed to "COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST"
- Deployed: commit 6ea0331

**Next Steps:**
- W9 pre-population feature (deferred)
- SPECS.md update for compliance checklist feature
- Consider showing compliance status column in Team Members list view

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (status field + employee_documents + doc uploads)

**Focus:** Employee status field, inactive contractors, compliance doc uploads.

**Accomplished:**
- Migration 006: Added `status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'` to `employees`; created `employee_documents` table (RLS enabled)
- Created Kirti Patel (id=17, pin=8177, status=inactive, email=kirti821@gmail.com)
- Created Sheila Ewart (id=18, pin=8182, status=inactive, email=she.ewart@gmail.com)
- Uploaded 18 compliance documents to Supabase Storage `onboarding-documents` bucket and inserted `employee_documents` rows:
  - Jade (11): DL, insurance, contract
  - Jodi (13): esthetician license, W9
  - Kirti (17): DL, insurance, W9, 2× other
  - Lucine (14): W9, BRN license, NSO insurance, contractor agreement, BLS cert, CPR cert
  - Vayda (15): W9
  - Sheila (18): contractor agreement
- Updated `server.js`: GET employees now returns `status`; PUT employees accepts + saves `status`
- Updated `supabase-schema.sql` + `migrations/006_employee_status_and_documents.sql` (via Supabase MCP)

**Diagram:**
```
iCloudDrive/LeMed Owners/1.0 LM Talent/
  Jade/       Jodi Kay/    Kirti Patel/   Lucine Keseyan/  Vayda/  _old/Sheila E/
    ↓ upload-employee-docs.mjs
Supabase Storage: onboarding-documents/employee-{id}/
    ↓ insert
employee_documents table (18 rows)
employees table: status col added; Kirti(17) + Sheila(18) = inactive
```

**Current State:**
- 9 employees total: 7 active contractors + 2 inactive (Kirti, Sheila)
- 18 docs in `employee_documents`, all with correct types and storage paths
- tax_filings: 6 rows (2024 1099-NEC data, all encrypted TINs)

**Issues:**
- Leena Osman still has no SSN — onboarding will need to collect it
- Sheila's `email with ID License W9.msg` not uploaded (Outlook .msg format, would need extraction)
- Kirti's image0/image2 uploaded as `other` — unclear what they are

**Next Steps:**
- Push to GitHub → Render deploy (picks up server.js status field changes)
- Lea Culver: no email in any source, cannot create record yet
- W9 pre-population feature (mentioned in onboarding email)
- Admin UI: show/filter by status, show documents tab in employee detail modal
- SPECS.md update for status + employee_documents features

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (tax_filings + 1099 import + RLS fix)

**Focus:** 1099 data import, tax_filings table + API, RLS fix, new employees.

**Accomplished:**
- Fixed critical bug: all 59 server.js DB queries switched from anon key → `supabaseAdmin` (service role), which bypasses RLS. RLS stays enabled on `employees` + `employee_onboarding` per Supabase security advisory.
- Created `tax_filings` table in production Supabase (migration 005-tax-filings.sql). RLS enabled.
- Added 7 tax_filings API routes to server.js: list (filter by year/employee), get by id, create, update, delete, export CSV (Avalara/Track1099-compatible format).
- Imported 2024 1099-NEC data for all 6 contractors from CSV:
  - Jade Gonzales: $34,168.10 (SSN last4: 1530)
  - Jodi Kay: $19,146.33 (SSN last4: 7478)
  - Salakjit Hanna: $13,397.00 (SSN last4: 3613) ← NEW employee created
  - Vayda Kasbah: $3,740.90 (SSN last4: 6454) ← NEW employee created
  - Leena Osman: $1,140.00 (no SSN in CSV)
  - Lucine Keseyan: $704.92 (SSN last4: 0041)
- Created employee records for Vayda Kasbah (pin=6764) and Salakjit Hanna (pin=3157) — they had emails in the CSV but were previously skipped.
- All TINs AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest.
- Added supabase-schema.sql documentation for tax_filings.

**Diagram:**
```
CSV (iCloudDrive)                     Supabase (production)
1099-NEC 2024 data                    employees (7 contractors)
  ↓ import-1099-2024.mjs               ├─ Jade Gonzales (id=11)
  ↓ encrypt SSN → AES-256-GCM         ├─ Leena Osman (id=12)
  ↓                                    ├─ Jodi Kay (id=13)
  └──────────────────────────────────► ├─ Lucine Keseyan (id=14)
                                        ├─ Vayda Kasbah (id=15) NEW
                                        └─ Salakjit Hanna (id=16) NEW
                                       tax_filings (6 rows, 2024)
```

**Current State:**
- 7 tax_filings API routes live in server.js (deploying on push)
- 6 tax_filing rows in production with encrypted TINs
- 7 active contractors in employees table
- RLS: enabled on employees + employee_onboarding, bypassed by service role

**Issues:**
- Vayda and Salakjit need onboarding links sent (emails available now)
- Kirti Patel, Sheila Ewart, Lea Culver still not in system (no email in any source)
- Leena Osman has no SSN in CSV — onboarding will need to collect it

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy: push server.js to trigger Render deploy
- Send onboarding links to Vayda (vkasbah@hotmail.com) and Salakjit (salakjithanna@icloud.com)
- Verify Twilio `+12134442242` is active for SMS send-link
- W9 pre-population (mentioned in onboarding email — not yet built)
- 1099 CSV export endpoint: test at `/api/admin/tax-filings/export/2024`
- SPECS.md update for tax_filings feature

---

## Session — 2026-04-16 (E2E test + DB fixes)

**Focus:** PayTrack onboarding E2E test — found and fixed two production bugs.

**Accomplished:**
- Ran full E2E: create employee → prefill → submit onboarding → verify DB → cleanup
- **Bug 1:** `driver_license_number` column missing from `employee_onboarding` — added via Supabase MCP. Every onboarding submit was returning 500.
- **Bug 2:** RLS enabled on `employees` + `employee_onboarding` with zero policies (deny-all). Disabled — paytrack uses its own auth, not Supabase Auth.
- Updated `supabase-schema.sql` to full production schema (was missing employee_onboarding table and ~6 months of columns).

**Diagram:**
```
Admin              Onboarding             DB (fixes applied)
POST /employees → token                employees (RLS=off ✓)
GET /prefill    → name/email/desig     employee_onboarding
POST /onboarding → validate+encrypt → driver_license_number col added ✓
employees.onboarding_completed_at ← marked
```

**Current State:** E2E passing. Both DB bugs fixed in production. Pushed to GitHub.

**Issues:** None known.

**Next Steps:**
- SMS send link: verify Twilio `+12134442242` is active (untested live)
- W9 pre-population (mentioned in onboarding email — not yet built)
- 1099 CSV export (deferred)
- SPECS.md update for v2 onboarding

---

## Session — 2026-04-15

**Focus:** Worker self-onboarding feature — end-to-end build

**Accomplished:**

- Migration SQL `002-worker-onboarding.sql`: 8 new columns on `employees` + new `employee_onboarding` table (~35 fields). Paste into Supabase SQL Editor to apply.
- `lib/onboarding-validation.js`: all validators (SSN, EIN, ZIP, phone, state, ABA checksum, DOB ≥18, future date, last4 extraction, full form validation)
- `test/validation.test.js`: 50 tests written red-first. All 50 pass.
- `server.js`: 4 new onboarding routes + employee creation auto-generates UUID token
- `public/onboarding.html`: 8-section form (Identity, Address, Tax, License, Insurance, Driver's License, Banking, Attestation) with PayTrack dark+gold styling, inline validation, reveal toggles for sensitive fields, success screen
- `public/admin.html` + `public/js/admin.js`: Employees tab updated — Onboarding column, Copy Link button, View Details modal (shows last-4 masked values only). Link shown in success banner after adding employee.
- `SPECS.md`: new Worker Self-Onboarding section with full requirements, API table, DB schema, validation table, design decisions

**Diagram:**

```
Admin creates employee
  → server generates onboarding_token (UUID)
  → link shown in success banner + copied to clipboard
  → employee receives link /onboarding/<uuid>
  → fills 8-section form (public, no auth)
  → POST /api/onboarding/:token
      → validates via onboarding-validation.js
      → inserts employee_onboarding row
      → sets employees.onboarding_completed_at
  → Admin: Employees tab shows ✓ COMPLETE + date + View Details modal
```

**Current State:**

- All code committed and pushed to GitHub (2 commits)
- Render auto-deploying (push at ~end of session)
- Tests: 50/50 passing

**Issues / Remaining:**

- **Migration not yet applied to Supabase production** — must paste `migrations/002-worker-onboarding.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor before the feature works in production
- pgsodium encryption deferred — `*_encrypted` columns store plaintext with `TODO(security)` comments; `*_last4` columns always populated correctly

**Next Steps:**

1. Apply migration to Supabase production: paste `timetracker/migrations/002-worker-onboarding.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor (project `skvsjcckissnyxcafwyr`)
2. Verify: create a test employee → copy onboarding link → fill form → verify DB row + admin "View Details"
3. (Future) Wire pgsodium for `tin_encrypted`, `bank_routing_encrypted`, `bank_account_encrypted`
4. (Future) Add email notification to worker when form is received (optional, not requested)
